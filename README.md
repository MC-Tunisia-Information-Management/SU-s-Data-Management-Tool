# SU-s-Data-Management-Tool
The "SUâ€™s Data" function retrieves data using a GraphQL query from AIESEC's GIS API, specifically targeting people registered within a specified timeframe. It fetches details such as ID, full name, contact information, registration date, program interests, application counts, status, local committee alignment, and referral type. The function then updates the fetched data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet named 'ðŸ“± sign ups', mapping program IDs to abbreviations and ensuring communication preferences are correctly set. Additionally, if a person's phone number is missing, it triggers a mutation query to update it. This script facilitates efficient data management and communication setup within the AIESEC ecosystem.
